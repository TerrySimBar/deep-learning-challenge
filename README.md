### Overview  
The purpose of this project is to use a deep learning neural network to create a binary classifier that can predict, with 75% or greater accuracy, whether applicants will be successful if funded by a nonprofit organization. The dataset contains more than 34,000 entities that have received funding from the organization in the past. The dataset contains information about each entity such as the type of organization, the use of the funding, the amount of funding, and the success of the entity.

The `src` folder in this repository contains the `analysis.md` file which details the project's key features, the steps taken to complete the project, and the results. The `analysis.md` file also has a summary of the results and recommendations for next steps to optimize the binary classifier model.
